   Something Fun!
   
   Progression Game
   ================
   
   The player must go underwater, each time they do, they collect resources and come back after a time
   After the time limit the player must resurface with whatever they collected.
   
   Goal:
   
   
   The player must collect the thing at the bottom of the ocean (whatever that may be) to escape, at that point they win.
   
   
   Resource types: metal, oil, plastic, others?
   progression system (every now and then the player can upgrade their air tank so they can stay under water for longer
   
   the player also needs to upgrade their suit, so they can go deeper without being crushed.
   
   The player will have to avoid enemies and obsticles in their way.
   
   Perhaps add some sort of bubble system so they can get air underwater without having to resurface.
